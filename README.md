# Techie Tower Touble

# Description: The goal of this project is to create a game that somewhat mimics the video game franchise Pac-Man. Pac-Man is an action maze chase video game where the player controls a character (Latechâ€™s bulldog) through an enclosed maze. The objective of our game is to consume all of the bones placed in the maze while simultaneously trying to find a way to exit the maze and trying to avoid running into LSU's tiger. When all of the bones are consumed and the exit is found, the player wins. If the player runs out of time or gets into contact with the tiger, they will lose a life and when there are no more lives, the game ends. Overall, our project's main goals and objectives is to create an enjoyable experience when playing our game of journeying through a maze.
