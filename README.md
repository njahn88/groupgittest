# Techies Tower Troubles

# Description: The goal of this project is to create a game that somewhat mimics the video game franchise Pac-Man. Pac-Man is an action maze chase video game where the player controls a character (Latechâ€™s bulldog) through an enclosed maze. The objective of our game is to consume all of the bones placed in the maze while simultaneously trying to find a way to exit the maze and trying to avoid running into LSU's tiger. If the player passes over an cell with an X points will be deducted from their score. There are two modes: the first is to play the entire game from the 1st to the 16th floor of WYLY TOWER.You can do this by press the play button on the main menu. The second option is to play a single level of your choosing. You can do this by clicking through the menu to choose the level you want to play and then htting the play button. Overall, our project's main goals and objectives is to create an enjoyable experience when playing our game of journeying through a maze.

# To play
- If you wish to play the game make sure to run the main.py file
- If you wish to just play the climb mode of the game (starting from the first floor going toward the top) but don't want to navigate the menu: 
  -  Switch the self.state variable in the app_class.py file to 'playing' and then run the main.py file
- If you wish to play a specific level without navigating the menu:
  - Switch the self.state variable in the app_class.py file to 'play level' and change the self.level variable to the level in which you want to play minus 1, then run the main.py file.
